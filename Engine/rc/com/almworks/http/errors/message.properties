  <h3>Problem connecting to server</h3>\
  <p>Client for Jira encountered a problem:</p>\
  <p><b>handshake alert:  unrecognized_name</b>.</p>\
  <p>The problem happened while Client for Jira was connecting to the remote server (<a href="ARG_URL">ARG_URL_SHORT</a>).\
  <p>In order to solve the problem Client for Jira needs to reconfigure itself. However, after the reconfiguration Client for Jira will not be able to connect to some other servers in rare cases.</p>\
  <p>Client for Jira recommends you to apply the reconfiguration. You can roll back the reconfiguration later, if you find out that Client for Jira stops working with another server.</p>\
  <p><b>If you are planning to work with only one Jira server, the reconfiguration is essential.</b></p>\
  <p>See below technical details and how to roll back Client for Jira configuration.</p>\
  <p>The reconfiguration requires you to restart Client for Jira to take effect. Client for Jira will not force you to restart immediately. You can reconfigure Client for Jira now and do restart any time later.</p>\
  <h3>How to roll back configuration of Client for Jira.</h3>\
  <p>Client for Jira will set system property "jsse.enableSNIExtension" to "false".</p>\
  <p>To roll back the change, please, open System Properties window (Main Menu | Tools | System Properties), find "jsse.enableSNIExtension" property and clear it's value.</p>\
  <h3>Technical details about the problem.</h3>\
  <p>The problem happens because the remote server is not able to handle SSL/TLS extensions. Generally, this happens because the server is configure incorrectly.</p>\
  <p>The system property mentioned above disables Server Name Indication (SNI) extension in Client for Jira. SNI is a TLS extension, defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4366.txt">RFC 4366</a>. It enables TLS connections to virtual servers, in which multiple servers for different network names are hosted at a single underlying network address.</p>\
