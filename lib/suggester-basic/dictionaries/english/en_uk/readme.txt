The wordlist is primarily intended to be useful for
checking spelling. Editorial policy is conservative.

Principal omissions:

   -   words requiring a capital letter
   -   abbreviations
   -   slang

Colloquialisms and archaisms are generally excluded. Contractions
are excluded. A rare word similar to a common word may be
excluded. Both -ise and -ize spellings are included.

The character set is: lowercase letters, hyphen, apostrophe.
Words which can be spelt with accents occur here in their
plain form.

If this wordlist is to be used with ispell the following
lines may be appropriate for the affix file:

   boundarychars [---]
   boundarychars '
   wordchars [a-z] [A-Z]

The commonest words are labelled 16 and the least common 0.

Coverage of common words should be good, but note the
categories excluded.
